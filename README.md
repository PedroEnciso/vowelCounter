# vowelCounter
This app will take a user input and tell them how many vowels were in the input.

This app was pretty straightforward, but I had some fun figuring out a response for every possible situtation (no vowels. one vowel, and many vowels). I also tried to give the app a little personality in its responses, seeing a sassy computer-generated response is always pretty funny to me.
